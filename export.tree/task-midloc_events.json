    "onset": {
        "Description": "Onset (in seconds) of the event measured from the beginning of the acquisition of the first volume in the corresponding task imaging data file. If any acquired scans have been discarded before forming the imaging data file, ensure that a time of 0 corresponds to the first image stored. In other words negative numbers in 'onset' are allowed."
    },
    "duration": {
        "Description": "Duration of the event (measured from onset) in seconds. Must always be either zero or positive. A 'duration' value of zero implies that the delta function or event is so short as to be effectively modeled as an impulse."
    },
    "weight": {
        "Description": "Column of files in bids_event_files based on the values of which to apply amplitudes to events. If unspecified, all events will be represented with an amplitude of 1"
    },
    "trial_type": {
        "Description": "Primary categorisation of each trial to identify them as instances of the experimental conditions. For example: for a response inhibition task, it could take on values 'go' and 'no-go' to refer to response initiation and response inhibition experimental conditions."
